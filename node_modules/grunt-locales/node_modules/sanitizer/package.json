I have just repackaged it to solve a problem I had (sanitization on a Node server). It seems to work, and it passes all its tests in re-packaged form - however I don't fully understand its internals so cannot guarantee its security.\n\n\n== More information\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/google-caja/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/caja/plugin/html-sanitizer.js\n",
