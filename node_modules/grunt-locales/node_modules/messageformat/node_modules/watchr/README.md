## Watchr. Node.js file watching that doesn't suck.

Watchr normalises the node.js watching functionality between 0.4's `fs.watchFile`, and 0.6's `fs.watch`, and adds support for watching entire directories including their far descendants (some call this recursive directory watching)


### Using

- JavaScript

	``` javascript
	// Requires
	require('coffee-script'); # watchr dependency
	var watchr = require('watchr');

	// Watch
	watchr.watch(path,function(){
		console.log('something changed inside the directory');
	});
	```

- CoffeeScript

	``` javascript
	# Requires
	watchr = require('watchr')

	# Watch
	watchr.watch path, ->
		console.log('something changed inside the directory')
	```


## Install

``` bash
npm install coffee-script watchr
```
